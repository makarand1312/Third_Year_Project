# To Check the impact of various components of atomobile on their price 

## Abstract : 
 The Aim of this project is to find out Which factors
affect the price of Cars. Now a days, most of people wishes to 
buy a car. The Characteristics of cars are Displacement (cc), 
colour, Seating Capacity, length, width and mileage.
 
 There are many factors affecting the price of cars i.e 
Fuel capacity , Ground clearness, shape and No of Airbags are 
the major determinants of the price of cars.
 
 So we decide to study on which factors affecting on 
the price of cars. We fit a regression model to predict the price 
of car of above Characteristics. We found that the price of car 
is mainly depends on Displacement(cc) and Fuel tank Capacity 
(litre). 
 
 From our project we can decide to predict the best car 
with comfort zone and affordable.

wheelers.
2. To compute different Types of drive wheels impact on 
price.
 To predict the linear regression model for Ground 
clearance with Height. 
3. To fit preferable model for Price with different 
components of vehicles for prediction.
4. To study and analyse the customers perception regarding 
the usefulness/utility of cars.
